# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Notes, assumptions and decisions made    
- The focus of the challenge was using API calls and manipulating data
- Only the key value environment: mock is required to receive an access token in the response
- Bearer token wasnt required to get dummy data
- Added a logout button to assist with testing
- No minimum length on username or password

## How long did the project take

- The Project took me around 8 hours to complete over a few days in sections
- Built the structure of the app and used dummy data to style it
- Added in Api calls and logic
- Fixed any obvious bugs as I went along
- Optimised by reducing re renders where possible


## With more time what would I improve
- Make the components lean, refactor the code
- Outsouce API calls to custom hooks or files or use Axios and make them generic and reusable
- Add units test
- Use more of the available data and add tabs to MyPolicyData.js to switch between sections
- Set a minimum length on username or password
- Set basic validation on username and password


## Conclusion

Was a nice little project, will finish it off when I have time and add it as a github project. Over ran on time as I got carried away with styling and loading animations.
